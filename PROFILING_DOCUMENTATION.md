# Advanced Repository Profiling

This document provides an overview of the advanced repository profiling capabilities of the MegaLinter extension.

## Overview

The advanced profiling mechanisms provide deep insights into your repositories, enabling intelligent configuration generation, historical analysis, and cross-repository comparisons.

## Features

### 1. Enhanced Language Detection

- **AST-based analysis**: Accurately detects languages beyond file extensions.
- **Dialect and version detection**: Identifies specific language dialects and versions (e.g., ES6+, Python 3).
- **Confidence scoring**: Provides a confidence score for each detected language.

### 2. Framework Recognition

- **Intelligent detection**: Detects frameworks and libraries through dependency and pattern analysis.
- **Version detection**: Identifies the versions of detected frameworks.
- **Architecture patterns**: Recognizes architecture patterns like MVC, MVVM, etc.

### 3. Team Preference Analysis

- **Coding style detection**: Analyzes code to detect team coding styles and preferences.
- **Commit pattern analysis**: Analyzes git history to identify commit patterns and author activity.
- **Code ownership**: Maps code ownership based on commit history.

### 4. Historical Trend Analysis

- **Code quality trends**: Tracks code quality metrics over time to identify trends.
- **Technical debt tracking**: Monitors technical debt accumulation and identifies refactoring opportunities.
- **Development velocity**: Analyzes commit history to track development velocity.

### 5. Multi-Repository Profiling

- **Organization-wide analysis**: Enables analysis and comparison of multiple repositories.
- **Cross-repository patterns**: Detects common patterns and standards across repositories.
- **Standards compliance**: Compares repositories against organization-defined standards.

### 6. Machine Learning Integration

- **Pattern recognition**: Uses machine learning to identify complex code patterns.
- **Optimal configuration**: Predicts optimal MegaLinter configurations based on repository profiles.
- **Anomaly detection**: Detects anomalies in code patterns and team activity.

## Usage

The advanced profiling capabilities are integrated into the MegaLinter extension and can be used to:

- **Generate intelligent configurations**: Automatically generate optimal MegaLinter configurations based on repository profiles.
- **Visualize repository insights**: View detailed analytics and visualizations in the MegaLinter dashboard.
- **Track historical trends**: Monitor code quality and technical debt trends over time.
- **Compare repositories**: Analyze and compare multiple repositories across your organization.

## Configuration

The advanced profiling features can be configured in the extension settings:

- **Enable/disable analyzers**: Enable or disable specific analyzers (e.g., team analytics, history analysis).
- **Set performance options**: Configure performance options like caching, incremental analysis, and timeouts.
- **Define organization standards**: Define organization-wide standards for compliance checking.
